  "foodie_blog_title": "Why Catalonia is a hidden gem for foodies",
  "foodie_blog_p1": "When people think of global food capitals, places like Paris, Tokyo or New York often steal the spotlight. But just a few hours from these culinary giants lies a region quietly building a reputation as one of the most exciting food destinations in Europe: Catalonia. With a unique blend of tradition, creativity, and terroir, this northeastern corner of Spain is a paradise for food lovers ‚Äî yet still feels refreshingly undiscovered.",
  "foodie_blog_h2_1": "A Land of Contrasts on the Plate",
  "foodie_blog_p2": "Catalonia offers incredible culinary diversity thanks to its rich geography. In the same weekend, you can sip DO Empord√† wines at a sun-soaked vineyard near the Mediterranean, taste fresh seafood straight off the Costa Brava, and dine in a Michelin-starred restaurant hidden in the Pyrenees.",
  "foodie_blog_p3": "The famous phrase ‚Äúmar i muntanya‚Äù (sea and mountain) isn‚Äôt just a poetic description ‚Äî it‚Äôs a culinary philosophy. Many Catalan dishes blend flavours of both land and sea, such as chicken with prawns, or cuttlefish with peas and sausage.",

  "foodie_blog_p4": "Did you know that Barcelona alone has 39 Michelin stars across nearly 30 restaurants? Some of the world‚Äôs most influential chefs ‚Äî like the Roca brothers or Albert Adri√† ‚Äî call Catalonia home. Whether you're after molecular gastronomy or reinterpretations of ancient recipes, Catalonia delivers on every level.",
  "foodie_blog_p5": "But what makes the region special isn‚Äôt just the number of stars ‚Äî it‚Äôs the accessibility. You can enjoy a tasting menu with sea views or a cosy farm-to-table lunch in a medieval village without the formality (or the price tag) you'd expect in bigger cities.",
  "foodie_blog_h2_3": "A Culture That Celebrates Ingredients",
  "foodie_blog_p6": "Catalan food is deeply rooted in seasonality and locality. Visit a food market like La Boqueria or Mercat de Sant Antoni and you‚Äôll see locals buying fresh artichokes, mushrooms, or cal√ßots depending on the season. Join a cal√ßotada (a spring onion feast) in February or enjoy grilled sardines by the beach in summer ‚Äî every season brings its own food traditions.",
  "foodie_blog_h2_4": "Why Now Is the Perfect Time to Visit",
  "foodie_blog_p7": "Despite its incredible food scene, Catalonia has remained under the radar for many international travellers. That‚Äôs changing fast. With increasing interest in authentic, local travel, now is the time to explore before the crowds arrive.",
